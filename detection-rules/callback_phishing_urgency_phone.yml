name: "Callback phishing: Urgency with phone number from new or suspicious sender"
description: |
  Detects inbound messages that combine urgency language in the subject line
  (e.g., "action required", "important notice") with a phone number in the body,
  sent from a new or suspicious sender. This pattern is characteristic of callback
  phishing (vishing) campaigns where scammers impersonate companies or government
  agencies and direct victims to call a fraudulent phone number. Examples include
  fake bankruptcy notices, warranty expirations, and tax filing deadlines.
